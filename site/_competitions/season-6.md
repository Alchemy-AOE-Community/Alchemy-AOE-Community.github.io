    notes: | 
      - PlushWerewolf is an old friend from ViridArx days with over 2000 1v1s, but hasn't played many recently so not much of his data is available through aoe2.gg. Exception granted for minimum game count, with belief that calculated skill is representative of his current abilities. Eligible for prizes.

      - Mike'dugai new to the league, with insufficient 1v1s but agreed to play ineligible for prize money in Sprint 1. 

      - jasuni is a long time player in Alchemy League. Matchmaker has him well figured out. Eligible for prize money.
